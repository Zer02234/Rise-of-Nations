I would also like to remind everyone that we are working as hard as we can to expand the game from 1900 to 2060, in other words to make Hoi4 what we all think it should be. This isn't an easy or small task, so we ask you to please be patient with us. If you would like to help the mod, then please join our Discord and check out the How-To-Help Channels."
