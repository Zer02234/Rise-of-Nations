Krasnov is ready to ally with Ukraine and the new independent states from the former Russian Empire to fight the Bolsheviks. His priority is to attack Tsaritsyn and connect with the Eastern Whites before attacking Moscow with them.\n\n The second option was supported by Anton Denikin, leader of the Russian Volunteers. Denikin refuses to give up control of the Russian Empire territories and is not ready to recognize and ally with Ukraine and other neighboring countries from the former Tsars' Empire. Denikin's priority is to free the Kuban and North- Caucasus from the Bolsheviks before attacking Moscow from the South through the Ukraine. \N\N If you choose the Krasnov strategy and he succeeds in conquering the key town of Tsaritsyn this big victory will make him the leader of the Western Whites and, as the Don Cossack autonomist he would then ally with the Ukranian Nationalists instead of fighting them.
